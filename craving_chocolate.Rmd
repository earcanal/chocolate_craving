# Buddhist psychology and cognitive psychology 

Buddhist Psychology (Subjective)                 Cognitive Psychology (Objective)
--------------------------------                 --------------------
Abhidhamma (~3rd Century BCE)                    Mental states
Dependent Origination                            Mental processes
< craving < suffering (3rd noble truth)          > Mental health, abilities, happines
Meditation < craving                             Meditation as psychological intervention

- Does meditation work?
    - Yes (Buddhists)
    - Maybe (Psychology)
        - Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy: 43% risk reduction of depressive relapse with three or more previous episodes (Piet & Hougaard, 2011)

# A craving model of smoking

![Smoking habit as operant conditioning](images/addiction_loop.png)

- hard to avoid all cues
- substitute behaviours (e.g. exercise, relaxation) not always available
- ... therefore, target craving

# Can meditation reverse the craving cycle?

![Smoking habit as dependent origination](images/dependent_origination.png)

- Meditation < craving

# Reversing chocolate craving (experiment)

# Meditation doesn't reverse chocolate craving?

# Meditation _does_ reverse smoking craving

![Elwafi, Witkiewitz, Mallik, Thornhill, & Brewer (2013) ](images/elwafi_et_al.png)

- RCT; 8 sessions of "urge surfing" over 4 weeks
- abstainers report < craving; non-abstainers report > craving; positive correlation between craving and number of cigarettes smoked
- Craving reduction delayed

# Next steps: meditation and cognition

- < phone craving?
- Replicate
    - 15 mins < extinction and resurgence of laboratory conditioned response (McHugh, Procter, Herzog, Schock, & Reed, 2012)
    - et al. cognitive tasks (Chiesa, Calati, & Serretti, 2011)
- Dose effect
    - Objective measure of mindfulness (cf. TMS)
        - Are people meditating?  For how long?
    - Can more powerful interventions affect cognitive tasks more quickly
        - e.g. reduced attentional blink with 3 month retreat vs. 1 week practice (Slagter et al., 2007)
    - 8 week course; longitudinal effects on cognitive measures
